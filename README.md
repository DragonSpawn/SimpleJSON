# SimpleJSON
A C# json reader/writer which is Unity3D compatible

It is based on the version at http://wiki.unity3d.com/index.php/SimpleJSON with some additional improvements.
Sadly there is no official Github repo for this script so I ended up creating my own, while waiting for an official one to pop up
